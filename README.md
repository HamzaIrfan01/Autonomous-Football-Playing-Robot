Arduino Programming-Based Autonomous Football Robot

This project is an advanced Arduino programming-based robot that utilizes an STM32 Microcontroller to play football autonomously on a field in the presence of other robots. The robot features an RF transmission and receiver system for receiving and transmitting location coordinates, enabling it to perform different actions on the field.
